### Overview

HSSM is a Python toolbox that provides a seamless combination of state-of-the-art likelihood approximation methods with the wider ecosystem of probabilistic programming languages. It facilitates flexible hierarchical model building and inference via modern MCMC samplers. HSSM is user-friendly and provides the ability to rigorously estimate the impact of neural and other trial-by-trial covariates through parameter-wise mixed-effects models for a large variety of cognitive process models. HSSM is a <a href="https://ccbs.carney.brown.edu/brainstorm">BRAINSTORM</a> project in collaboration with the Center for Computation and Visualization and the Center for Computational Brain Science within the Carney Institute at Brown University.

- Allows approximate hierarchical Bayesian inference via various likelihood approximators.
- Estimate impact of neural and other trial-by-trial covariates via native hierarchical mixed-regression support.
- Extensible for users to add novel models with corresponding likelihoods.
- Built on PyMC with support from the Python Bayesian ecosystem at large.
- Incorporates Bambi's intuitive `lmer`-like regression parameter specification for within- and between-subject effects.
- Native ArviZ support for plotting and other convenience functions to aid the Bayesian workflow.
- Utilizes the ONNX format for translation of differentiable likelihood approximators across backends.

### [Official documentation](https://lnccbrown.github.io/HSSM/).

## Example

Here is a simple example of how to use HSSM:

```python
import hssm

# Set float type to float32 to avoid a current bug in PyMC
# This will not be necessary in the future
hssm.set_floatX("float32")

# Load a package-supplied dataset
cav_data = hssm.load_data('cavanagh_theta')

# Define a basic hierarchical model with trial-level covariates
model = hssm.HSSM(
    model="ddm",
    data=cav_data,
    include=[
        {
            "name": "v",
            "prior": {
                "Intercept": {"name": "Normal", "mu": 0.0, "sigma": 0.1},
                "theta": {"name": "Normal", "mu": 0.0, "sigma": 0.1},
            },
            "formula": "v ~ theta + (1|participant_id)",
            "link": "identity",
        },
    ],
)

# Sample from the posterior for this model
model.sample()
```

To quickly get started with HSSM, please follow [this tutorial](https://lnccbrown.github.io/HSSM/getting_started/getting_started/).
For a deeper dive into HSSM, please follow [our main tutorial](https://lnccbrown.github.io/HSSM/tutorials/main_tutorial/).

## Installation

Please follow the instruction below to install HSSM onto your local workspace. We have a more detailed [installation guide](https://lnccbrown.github.io/HSSM/getting_started/installation/) for users with more special setups.

**Important Update:** From HSSM 0.2.1 on, we recommend `conda` as the virtual environment manager for HSSM. We will also gradually make HSSM available directly through `conda-forge` in the near future. For now, please follow the instruction below to install HSSM:

### Step 1: Create a conda environment

If you haven't already, please follow the [Anaconda official website](https://www.anaconda.com/download) to install conda. We assume that you already have one of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download), [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html), [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases), or [mambaforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases) installed on your system and have access to either `conda` or `mamba` available on your command line.

To create a conda environment, use the following command. Substitute `mamba` for `conda` if `mamba` is available:

```bash
conda create -n <your-env-name> python=3.11
conda activate <your-env-name>
```

Substitute `<your-env-name>` with the name of the virtual environment that you choose. HSSM 0.2.0 and above supports Python versions 3.10 and 3.11.

### Step 2: Install PyMC through conda-forge

Installation through `conda-forge` is the official way of installing PyMC. This will also install other libraries such as `libblas` that PyMC requires to run properly.

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge pymc
```

### [Optional] Install JAX with CUDA support

If you need to sample with GPU, please install JAX with GPU support after installing PyMC following one of the two commands below:

#### Option 1: Install JAX with CUDA support via `conda`

At the moment, there is a community supported conda build on conda-forge:

```bash
conda install jaxlib=*=*cuda* jax cuda-nvcc -c conda-forge -c nvidia
```

#### Option 2: Install JAX with CUDA support via `pip`

Installing `jax` via `pip` should also work:

```bash
pip install jax[cuda12]
```

#### Support for Apple Silicon, AMD, and other GPUs

JAX also has support other GPUs. Please follow the [Official JAX installation guide](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) to install the correct version of JAX before proceeding.

### Step 3: Install `hssm` through `pip`

In the same environment, install `hssm` through `pip`.

```bash
pip install hssm
```

## Advanced Installation

### Install HSSM directly with Pip

`hssm` is also available through PyPI. You can directly install it with pip into any virtual environment via:

```bash
pip install hssm
```

**Note:** While this installation is much simpler, you might need optional dependencies to use JAX-based samplers and to produce model graphs. You might also encounter this warning message `WARNING (pytensor.tensor.blas): Using NumPy C-API based implementation for BLAS functions.` Please refer to our [advanced installation guide](https://lnccbrown.github.io/HSSM/getting_started/installation/) for more details.

### Install the dev version of HSSM

You can also install the bleeding-edge version of `hssm` directly from this repo:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/lnccbrown/HSSM.git
```

### Install HSSM on Google Colab

The good news is that Google Colab comes with PyMC and JAX pre-configured. That holds true even if you are using the GPU and TPU backend, so you simply need to install HSSM via pip on Colab regardless of the backend you are using:

```bash
!pip install hssm
```

## Troubleshooting

**Note:** Possible solutions to any issues with installations with hssm can be located
[here](https://github.com/lnccbrown/HSSM/discussions). Also feel free to start a new
discussion thread if you don't find answers there. We recommend installing HSSM into
a new conda environment with Python 3.10 or 3.11 to prevent any problems with dependencies
during the installation process. Please note that hssm is only tested for python 3.10,
3.11. As of HSSM v0.2.0, support for Python 3.9 is dropped. Use unsupported python
versions with caution.
